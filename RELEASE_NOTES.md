# Release Notes

## 0.1.2

- `codex-router sessions --new` starts a fresh Codex session through the router profile.
- `codex-router sessions` always offers a `New Codex session` picker choice.
- Session launches pass trailing Codex flags through, including `--yolo`, for both new and resumed sessions.
- Legacy router-owned `sessions --scope` remains rejected; use `--checkout`, `--repo`, or `--any`.
